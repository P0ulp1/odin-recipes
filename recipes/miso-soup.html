        <h3>This miso soup recipe is full of savory flavors. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white, or red miso paste for this soup â€” yellow miso is sweet and creamy, 
            red miso is stronger and saltier.</h3>
        <p>Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). Instant dashi granules are sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength.</p>
